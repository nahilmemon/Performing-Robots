# Final Project Progress Report
## Goals
### Thursday Nov 16th
* Figure out how much current the motor for The Wanderer's fan needs.
* Fix the fitting of the fan to fit on the motor.
* Test the fan on the motor to see if it can blow The Navigator.
* Observe the design of the computer fan that James was using.
### Tuesday Nov 21st
#### Communication between Devices
* Research how to set up a network of three XBees
* Set up this network and test that all devices are communicating with each other properly.
#### Control Box
* Build the circuit for the XBee, joystick, buttons and possibly the keyboard.
* Decide whether to use the keyboard or a couple of buttons.
* Write and test code in Arduino:
  * Joystick to move The Wanderer.
  * Button to turn the fan of The Wandere on/off.
  * Buttons or keyboard to send messages to The Navigator.
#### The Wanderer
* Write up and test the Arduino code to move The Wanderer based on the information from the joystick on the control box.
* Design a preliminary PCB board for the circuit.
#### The Navigator 
* Talk to Jon or Robert to see if they can help figure out how to design/make the sail for The Navigator.
* Talk to Dan about how to construct The Navigator (balsa wood strips, veneer method, or any other suggestions he has).
* Write and test code in Arduino:
  * Table to map letter/number positions to servo positions.
  * Parse the message given from the control box.
  * Convert a given letter/number to the two servo positions.
  * Pause between each letter/number without a delay.
* Finalize the PCB design.

## Findings
### The Wanderer
* The fan can't blow The Navigator (the version made out of the tissue box, and without any electronics in it (which are heavy). There wasn't really any air flow at the center of the area in front of the fan. Rather, the air was flowing more around the edges of the fan. So I definitely should try to design a shroud and slight funnel of sorts to try to direct the air where I want it to go.
